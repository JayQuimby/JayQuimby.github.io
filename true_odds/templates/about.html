This neural network is trained utilizing the historical statistics data of the past decade. Currently, its predictive capabilities are focused on forecasting outcomes in NCAAF games, with plans for expansion into additional domains in the near future. The architecture of this artificial neural network is characterized by its simplicity, featuring seven layers and approximately 15 million parameters.
<br><br>
The dynamic nature of the training and validation accuracy is attributed to the continual integration of new data into the model. On a broader scale, the model consistently converges to a 75% evaluation accuracy, emphasizing its proficiency in binary classification tasks. The numerical values presented on the platform as "probabilities" correspond to the softmax outputs generated by the model.

It is pertinent to note that the underlying data driving the model's predictions is acquired through web scraping methods and undergoes weekly updates to ensure its relevance and reliability.
